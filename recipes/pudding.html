    <h1>Bread</h1>
    <h2>May be eaten torn or whole. Improved with fats and salts.</h2>

    <p>Thy laborers having reaped and ground much barley, thou shalt instruct thy cooks thusly:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Having measured out a stone's worth of grain, collect and place it in a basin.</li>
      <li>Setting this aside, pour a stone of iced water, taking a draught for thyself so that not quite a stone's worth remains.</li>
      <li>Combine the water and grain and, having added the desirable salt, cycle it thoroughly so that it takes shape.</li>
      <li>Take some oil, with it coating both bread pan and lump.</li>
      <li>Place thy pan in a fired hovel, not removing hence if it has not dried.</li>
      <li>At the appropriate time, remove the fresh bread and set aside to cool.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Pudding</h1>
    <h2>On such occasion as a fresh slaughter, whether beast or enemy, blood can be reserved for a rich pudding which imbues much vigor.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Take together two stones of blood and at least one stone of water.</li>
      <li>Add then a heaping pinch of dried honey, also some salt, and less still some dried ginger root.</li>
      <li>Do not agitate thy bloody soup lest thou hast also measured and added one stone and half again of ground barley.</li>
      <li>Goat butter, or thy desired fat, then add to a fired pan and once active make a thin layer proceeding from thy basin.</li>
      <li>Do not delay, for the pudding is quick and will burn unattended.</li>
      <li>Thou may also take belly of pork to the fire and crisp it, for this with also a cloudberry preserve is most to be desired.</li>
    </ol>
