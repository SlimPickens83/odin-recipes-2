    <h1>The Collected, Delirious Recipes of Mighty Odin</h1>
    <p>In sundry times and lands, our forefathers told of the mighty Odin and the wondrous deeds he wrought. Now, at the time of our present suffering, we have been blessed to receive ancient witness to the feasts and fetes of the gods.</p>
    <p>These are the storied suppers recorded on the many tablets of Caer Bannog, only recently discoverd by Erik the Famished. The elders have conferred and agreed that these could have been etched by none other than Andhrimnir himself.</p>
